# sandwichfactory2
Complete reformat of the oldest parts of sandwich factory.
SandwichFactory2 is just the working name. Sounds better than FireBoyandWaterGirlClone

This is meant to make the core components of the game more similar to a library rather than depending on the game itself

# sandwich-factory-raylib
A remake of my first game with unity, on raylib, making it also my first game made with raylib.

Features:
  * Lever-controlled doors
  * Crates with custom physics
    * Can be grabed
  * Camera following (not seen in game)
  * You choose your own FPS and resolution
    * Any selected FPS above 30 is 100% functional (ie. if you have a high refresh rate monitor, you can choose a higher FPS)
    * Recommended Resolution >= 540p
    * _Only supported aspect ratio is 16:9!!_

New to Beta 2:
  * It is now possible to load custom files
    * Ladders are supported in the files but will not be rendered in the game.
  * I don't plan on making a documentation yet so please refer to the dataHandling.h file where I kept my info

Future Features (not yet ported to raylib version):
  * Ladders
  * Portals
  * Crates can interact among themselves
