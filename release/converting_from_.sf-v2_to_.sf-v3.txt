Differences between .sf version 2.0 and .sf version 3.0
-------------------------------------------------------

!!! BREAKING Changes !!!

- Properties are now their own struct
    The property name should now be expressed as a string
    eg. ~sp=@(2,2) would now be ~("sp", @(2, 2))

- PhysObjs must have a Vector for position now
    ex. v2 = ^(181,58,15,13,f,t)
        v3 = ^(@(181,58),15,13,false,true)

- Removed wallNum, leverNum, doorNum
    They are now auto-set by using the new Lever(), Door(), and Wall() structs

- Doors, Levers, Portals are now their own structs. Refer to new argument structure

- Level Collider and Ladders have had arguments which have been stripped
    Only 4 arguments now in LevelCols, as the other were only required by Levers, Doors, and Walls before
    Ladders now match Wall()

- Vector2Float has been removed. Regular Vector2 types now accept floats 
- Booleans must be either "true" or "false", you cannot use "t" or "f" or integers anymore
- Strings must now be surrounded in quotes
- wallNum has been renamed to wallImgNum

## Other changes ##
- Whitespace is now 100% supported anywhere
- Commas are no longer required to seperate items, although they're still recommended to keep your files clean looking
- Square brackets and parentheses are interchangeable
