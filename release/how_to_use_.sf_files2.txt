Documentation - How to use the .sf file

There are many objects in the game and each have their own type and represeting character

/ acts as a single line comment (aka: you can write anything on the same line and it will be skipped by the file reader)
; seperates each object (if on same line)
! = terminates the file immediately (cannot be done within a string, deprecated)

Properties
    ~ = property   =  ~propertyname=data;

    Property names
    img              - string   (level Image)
    sp               - Vector2  (starting point)
    sp2              - Vector2  (starting point - player 2)
    isMultiplayer    - bool     (enable player 2?)
    leverNum         - int      (must specify lever num if using levers)
    doorNum          - int      (must specify if using doors)

Structs
    % = level collider   = %(x,  y,  sizeX,sizeY,isTrigger, enabled, tag)
                             int,int,int,  int,  bool,      bool,    int
    * = ladder collider  = same as levelCollider but with star   = *()
    # = toggled wall col = same as levelCollider but with hastag = #()

    ^ = Physics object   = ^(position,sizeX,sizeY,trigger,enabled)
                             Vector2, int,  int,  bool,   bool

    & = textBox          = &(x, y,  size,text,  colour)
                            int,int,int, string,colour

    # = wallTag          = #(wallID, tag)
                             int,    int

		  Notes: The string must be expressed without quotes. 
		              Any attempts to add a comma in the text must be preceeded by a backslash ( \, ) This will display only the comma.
    
    Note: Spaces are strongly disencouraged in structs since this breaks anything involving bool because of my lazy coding. Please don't add spaces inside a struct unless you're entering a string

Types
    @ = vector 2 (int)   = @(x,y)
    @f= vector 2 (float) = @f(x,y) broken (do not use)
        instead, input the numbers directly; 0,0 instead of @(0,0)
    ? = colour     = ?(r,g,b,a)

Examples can be found in the custom_levels/template folder.


Extra notes:
The file does not need to have the .sf extension since its just a text file (it's just cool to have .sf)
